Evaluating courses/academics is a tedious process that every student has to go through a lot to view their grades.
These scripts automate the evaluation process, while being customizable.

## To evaluate academics
simply paste the evaluate-academics.js code into your browser's console.

## To evaluate courses
simply paste the evaluate-courses.js code into your browser's console.

### tips
To open Google chrome's console right click on the form and click on inspect element, you'll find the console tab.

### customization
- var grade = 0; // holds grade 0 for strongly agree 5 for strongly disagree
- var attendance = '0'; // holds the attendance, 0 for always
- var studyTime = '5'; // hold the study time, 0 for 1 hr, 5 for 6 hrs
- var amountOfWork = '2'; // holds the amount of work, 0 very great and 5 very low
- If you don't want the form to auto submit, remove the last line of code
